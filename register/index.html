                <h3>This year's conference themes:</h3>
                <ul class="themes">
                    <li><em>Living the Map</em> &mdash; Maps have long been a source of power, control and wealth in the world.  How is OpenStreetMap's free map changing the communities that you live in or work with?  What are the social implications of a free and open map in different countries around the world?  How can OpenStreetMap help make the world a better place</li>
                    <li><em>Mapping for the Masses</em> &mdash; OpenStreetMap has come a long way in the last 5 years.  But how can we make sure OpenStreetMap continues to grow and thrive for the next 5 years?  "Mapping for the Masses" invites speakers to present about their thoughts, opinions, projects or tools that will help OpenStreetMap grow and help its open map become the richest and most detailed in the world.</li>
                    <li><em>OpenStreetMap Tech Talk</em> &mdash; 
                   OpenStreetMap has a vibrant community of hackers, systems administrators and app developers whose work keeps OpenStreetMap going and growing.  Maybe you are working on a new OpenStreetMap editor, plugin,  renderer, API or application that you'd like to share with everyone.  If you hang out on OSM-Dev, dream in bash syntax and know OpenStreetMap's API structure off by heart, this is the place for you to share your knowledge and ideas. </li>
                    <li><em>Powered by OpenStreetMap</em> &mdash; In the last 12 months, OpenStreetMap powered apps have appeared in app stores and on the web like never before.  More organisations from governments to universities, NGOs, navigation providers and web portals are using OpenStreetMap than every before.  This session invites any users of OpenStreetMap to share their experiences creating OpenStreetMap powered applications and services.</li>
